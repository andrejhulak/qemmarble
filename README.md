Marble QEM with RNN/LSTM/ANN

So, to work with it,

the method names should be pretty self-explanatory, but I will add some text to them so it makes
more sense. The one RNN/LSTM one qubit idea should now be working properly. There are 5000 training
and 1000 testing circuits in /data. I will start experimenting with the hyperparameters now and 
try to put in the Transfomer architecture also.

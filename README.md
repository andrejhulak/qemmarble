Marble QEM with RNN/LSTM/ANN

So, to work with it,

all the files that have 0000_ in front of their name are actual code. I will clean them up - also the RNN's aren't working correctly 
as of right now I think (I'm finishing up a tutorial as I'm writing this), so I will remake them.

I will provide generated circuits and I've made methods to save/load them - that way we can always experiment with the same random circuits. 
(I will let it generate 4000 training and 800 testing circuits during the night today - can create even more to obtain better data)

At some point I will also add a guide on the available methods - probably later.

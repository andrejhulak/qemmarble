QEM with RNN/LSTM/ANN

For Vincenzo:

where is zne: zne is in zne.ipynb and zne_mitiq.ipynb
their data: in the data folder it's the 2 files called ising_init_from_qasm_coherent and no_readout
my data is in: circuits - for qc objects and features - that is already the pytorch conversion of the qc into lists and whatnot
my results on theirs is in rf_experiment_our_mode.ipynb (on the 4400 training and 1600 testing circs that look kinda similar)
their results on theirs is in rf_experiment_rf_them.ipynb - that's exactly their code just shift run all of the cells and it is the exact same results - but this experiment is not in the paper (I think)
- this is also the circs that look similar (on the 4400 training and 1600 testing circs that look kinda similar - these ones)

I will meanwhile do the other experiments. If there's anything not working with requirements or anything else let me know, I will reply asap.

Marble QEM with RNN/LSTM/ANN

So, to work with it,

I will provide generated circuits and I've made methods to save/load them - that way we can always experiment with the same random circuits. 
(I will let it generate 4000 training and 800 testing circuits during the night today)
I will also make methods to intialise the models and training/testing methods - so the experiments can be as clean as possible.
